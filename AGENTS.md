  # Repository Guidelines
  
  ## Project Structure & Module Organization

  - This project is a code generator which generates swift code, but the codebase is written in C++. The code for the code generator is in the `swiftwinrt` subdirectory
     - `file_writers.h` dictates how each code file is written that is produced by the generator
     - `code_writers` directory contains all the different methods which generate various parts of the code. These are broken up into different types (Classes/Structs/Enums/Delegates/Interfaces)
     - everything else is helpers
  - Tests are in the `tests` subfolder. There is a `test_app` subfolder which contains code for all the test cases and the executable which runs them. There is also a `test_component` folder, this houses the c++ code which the `swiftwinrt` project generates swift bindings code for.
  - Code in the `tests/test_component/Sources` subfolder is generated by `swiftwinrt` as part of the build. These files should not be hand-edited. When you make changes to `swiftwinrt` and re-build, these should be automatically updated.

  ## Build, Test, and Development Commands

  - If you need to setup a machine after first cloning the repository, you need to run these commands:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update --recursive
  winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsSDK.10.0.26011

  - To build run the following three commands: 
     cmake --preset release
     cmake --build --preset release
     cmake --build --preset --release --target install
  - The first command configures the project for cmake (this is only needed if you modify a cmake file)
  - The second command builds the project
  - The third command installs the project so that we can run tests


  Coding Style & Naming Conventions

  - For C++ guidelines, names are generally `foo_bar` rather than `fooBar`. 
  - For Swift, just standard swift naming of camelCase
  - All code uses 4 spaces for indentation
  
  Testing Guidelines

  - Tests use XCTest, but are run as part of an executable and don't use XCTest directly. Due to this, test cases have to be manually added to the list. Follow existing patterns to add new tests.
  - To run tests, execute the `out/release/bin/test_app.exe` if it exits with a non-zero exit code, a test failed.

  Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

  - there are no guidelines on PR summary, just explain the reason for the change and what the change does. include bullet points for the main changes.
